VEGF inhibitors,"<p>Abnormal activation of kinases plays a crucial role in the development of various types of cancer. The VEGF signaling pathway can be inhibited by administering monoclonal antibodies via intravenous injection against circulating VEGF or by taking small-molecule TKI orally to target the VEGF receptor. VEGF inhibitors are used to treat different types of cancer, including renal, thyroid, and hepatocellular carcinomas <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244"">(ESC, 2022)</a>.</p>","<p>The mechanism of action of VEGF inhibitors involves targeting the angiogenesis process. These drugs work in two primary ways:<br /><br /><strong>Monoclonal Antibodies<br /></strong>These intravenously administered drugs directly target circulating VEGF molecules. By binding to VEGF, these antibodies prevent it from interacting with its receptors on the surface of endothelial cells. This inhibits the signaling pathways that normally lead to angiogenesis (<a href=""https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.08856"">Bair, 2013; ESC, 2022</a>). Monoclonal antibodies include aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ramucirumab.<br /><br /><strong>Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs)<br /></strong>These orally taken small molecules target the VEGF receptors located on endothelial cells. TKIs disrupt the downstream signaling pathways that promote angiogenesis by inhibiting these receptors. This includes preventing the activation of kinases, which are enzymes that play a critical role in cell signaling and are implicated in cancer progression as well as cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis (Bair, 2013; ESC, 2022). TKIs include Axitinib, Cabozantinib, Lenvatinib, pazopanib, regorafenib, sorafenib, Sunitinib, and Vandetanib.<br />By blocking the VEGF signaling pathway, these drugs effectively reduce the blood supply to tumors, limiting their growth and spread.<br /><br />The pathophysiological mechanisms behind the myocardial toxicity associated with VEGF inhibitors (VEGFI) remain largely unexplored. While the hypertensive effects of VEGFI are considered significant, the key factors seem to be disruptions in cardiac energy production through AMP-kinase inhibition and mitochondrial dysfunction, alongside the impacts of inhibiting VEGF, PDGFR, and c-Kit signaling pathways. These alterations may lead to decreased myocardial contractility or increased myocardial susceptibility to additional or concurrent stressors, such as hypertension. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) target a wide array of pathways, including both those intended (""""on-target"""", affecting both cancer cells and heart cells) and unintended (""""off-target"""") kinases due to the drugs' limited specificity. The direct effects on the target can cause cardiac toxicity or hinder the heart's normal compensatory mechanisms under stress. VEGF plays a crucial role in the heart's hypertrophic response to stress, including stress induced by hypertension. Moreover, VEGF-A levels are lower in myocardial biopsies from patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, with decreased VEGF-A mRNA levels also linked to tissue rarefaction, contributing to hypoxia and the activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd3252"">Force, 2011</a>, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd3252"">Richards, 2011</a>, <a href=""http://doi.org/DOI:%2010.1038/8379"">Carmeliet 1999</a>,<a href=""http://doi.org/%20doi:%2010.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.08856"">Touyz, 2017</a>)</p>","<p><strong>Monoclonal Antibodies</strong></p>

<p>(<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244"">ESC, 2022</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p><strong>Hypertension</strong><br />Hypertension is the most common CV adverse effect of VEGFi. It could happen within hours to days. Patients with pre-existing hypertension or CVD, older age, history of hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking, and previous anthracycline use are at greater risk. Blood pressure should be monitored closely during treatment with VEGFi. Early diagnosis and management of hypertension are crucial to prevent other cardiovascular complications of VEGFi therapy, particularly HF. Patients with pre-existing hypertension should have controlled blood pressure before initiation of VEGFi. VEGFi-associated hypertension is dose-dependent and is usually reversible with discontinuing the treatment.</p>
<p>The decision to start BP treatment and BP target is made according to the BP management guidelines. ACE-I or ARBs are the recommended first-line therapy for the treatment of hypertension. In severe hypertension (systolic BP &ge;180 mmHg or diastolic BP&ge;80 mmHg), MDT should evaluate the patient, and the therapy should be discontinued or temporarily interrupted until BP is controlled (systolic BP &lt;160 mmHg and diastolic BP &lt;100 mmHg). Therapy would be restarted when BP is controlled (dose reduction should be considered).</p>
<p><br /> After stopping VEGFi therapy, BP decreases. Therefore, the dose of antihypertensive therapy must be decreased or stopped as needed. (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244"">ESC, 2022</a>) </p>
<p><strong>Acute Coronary syndrome</strong><br />Diagnosis and management of ACS are made using the same guidelines as for patients without cancers. However, the management of ACS in any patient with cancer is more challenging due to concomitant cancer (bleeding risk, frailty, thrombocytopenia, increased thrombotic risk). Cancer therapy should be interrupted, and the decision to restart therapy is made after a multidisciplinary discussion. (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244"">ESC, 2022</a>)</p>
<p><strong>QTc Prolongation</strong> <br />Diagnosis and Treatment of QTc prolongation follow the general guidelines for patients without cancer. (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244"">ESC, 2022</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Heart Failure</strong> <br />In the ESC guidelines, there is no recommendation for the management of HF in patients on VEGFi. The United States Prescribing Information recommends discontinuing sunitinib in patients presenting with clinical signs of congestive heart failure. In patients without clinical signs of CHF but who exhibit a decrease in ejection fraction greater than 20% and less than 50% from baseline or below the normal lower limit if baseline ejection fraction measurements are unavailable, sunitinib should be interrupted or dose-adjusted accordingly.

Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,"<p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a novel class of therapeutic agents, primarily comprising monoclonal antibodies. ICIs are currently employed either alone or in conjunction with other chemotherapeutic agents as first or second-line treatment options for approximately 50 types of cancer (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17670-y"">Robert, 2020</a>).</p>","<p>The immune checkpoints are proteins expressed in the T cells that inhibit their activation when they contact a body cell. ICIs include monoclonal antibodies that block the immune brakes or regulators, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed death-1 (PD-1) , and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed in the cancer cells, with the consequent cytotoxic immune response. By blocking these checkpoints from binding with their partner proteins, ICIs inhibit the &lsquo;off&rsquo; signal, activating T cells and promoting the killing of cancer cells&rdquo; (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244"">ESC, 2022</a>).</p>","<p><strong>Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fulminant: hemodynamic instability, HF requiring non-invasive or invasive ventilation, high-grade or complete AV block, or significant ventricular arrhythmias</li>
<li>Non-fulminant: symptomatic but hemodynamically and electrically stable</li>
</ul>
<p>In all suspected cases, temporary interruption of ICIs is recommended, while diagnostic workup is being completed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The decision to resume vs. permanently discontinuing ICI therapy in suspected (but not confirmed) cases should be made only after a multidisciplinary discussion with the cardiologist/cardio-oncologist and oncologist.</li>
<li>In confirmed fulminant or non-fulminant myocarditis, the discontinuation of ICI therapy is recommended.</li>
<li>The patient should be admitted to the hospital. Those with fulminant myocarditis (hemodynamic or electrical instability) should be admitted to ICU.</li>
<li>All patients should have continuous ECG monitoring.</li>
<li>Heart failure, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or pericardial effusion should be managed per guidelines.</li>
<li>Once the diagnosis of myocarditis is likely (non-fulminant or fulminant), patients should receive methylprednisolone 500-1000 mg IV bolus once a day for 3-5 days. In clinically unstable patients with suspected myocarditis (before a definitive diagnosis is made), a single dose of methylprednisolone IV is appropriate.</li>
<li>Once clinically improved (resolution of left ventricular dysfunction, AV block, or ventricular arrhythmias, decrease in cTn by 50% from the peak level within 1-3 days), we can switch to oral prednisolone starting at 1 mg/kg per day (maximum dose 80 mg/day).</li>
<li>There is no consensus on the most appropriate protocol for tapering steroids. However, ESC recommends reducing the dose of prednisolone by 10 mg per week with close monitoring of the symptoms, ECG, and troponin levels.</li>
<li>LV function and troponin level should be reassessed once the dose of prednisone reaches 20 mg once daily. If stable, continue tapering off the prednisone by 5 mg per week, reaching 5 mg once a day. Finally, reduce the dose by 1 mg per week. Troponin should be monitored throughout the weaning protocol.</li>
<li>If no clinical improvement (resolution of left ventricular dysfunction, AV block or ventricular arrhythmias, decrease in cTn by 50% from the peak level within 1-3 days) after 3 days of methylprednisolone boluses, second-line immunosuppression is indicated, such as mycophenolate mofetil, anti-thymocyte globulin, intravenous immunoglobulin, tocilizumab, abatacept, alemtuzumab, tofacitinib, and plasma exchange. A multidisciplinary discussion is recommended before choosing the best regimen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recovery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Complete recovery is characterized by the total alleviation of symptoms, the return to normal levels of biomarkers, and the restoration of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) following the cessation of immunosuppressive therapy. While CMR might continue to show late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) or increased T1 signaling indicative of fibrosis, there should be no signs of acute edema.</li>
<li>In selected patients with previous uncomplicated ICI-associated myocarditis, the decision to either permanently discontinue or resume ICI therapy should only be made after a multidisciplinary discussion, once the patient is off steroids.<br />(<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244"">ESC, 2022</a>)</li>

TKI,"<p>Definition: ABL is an oncoprotein that loses its physiological role of moving between the nucleus and cytoplasm when it fuses with BCR. ABL tyrosine kinase activity is activated when it combines with BCR and this triggers a cascade of reaction in the cytoplasm. The subsequent interaction of this activated complex with major proteins in the oncogenic pathway leads to the disruption of key cellular processes in the body. Examples include interference with the MAPK which leads to increased proliferation, Disruption of the JAK-STAT pathway leading to impaired transcription activity, and increased apoptosis with its interaction with the PI3K/AKT pathway.&nbsp; BCR-ABL is implicated in CML, Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL. ) (<a href=""https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/18/4/930/77476/Molecular-Pathways-BCR-ABLBCR-ABL"">Saglio et al, 2011</a>)</p>","<p>Notably, ICIs can induce aberrant activation of T cells, extending beyond tumor eradication to attack non-neoplastic tissues, thereby precipitating immune-related adverse events.

<p>The incidence of QTc prolongation is higher in TKIs (6.8%) than in other anticancer agents (1.2%). Although it is relatively common with TKIs, especially the 3rd generation, Prolong QTc is a black box warning for Nilotinib. Inhibition of P13K signaling with subsequent changes in Na and K current, account for most of the QTc prolongation seen.</p>
<p>A change in QT interval more than 60ms from baseline doesn&rsquo;t warrant a change in TKI as long as QTc is below 500ms.</p>
<p>While on TKI, other causes of QTc prolongation should be identified and treated. Hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcemia. The presence of other TKI-prolonging drugs should be looked at.<br /> <br /><strong>Before starting QT-prolonging TKI</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fluid retention</strong></p>
<p>TKI usage commonly leads to fluid retention as a side effect, believed to result from the inhibition of PDGFR signaling, which plays a role in interstitial fluid homeostasis.<br />Standard management involves the use of diuretics and providing supportive care. Evaluation of cardiac, renal, hepatic, and thyroid functions, along with monitoring serum protein and albumin levels, is essential. If necessary, the TKI dosage can be reduced or discontinued. Ultrasound is recommended for diagnosing and monitoring patients exhibiting signs of pulmonary edema, pericardial or pleural effusion, as well as ascites.

HSCT,"<p>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation also known as bone marrow transplant is a medical procedure that involves infusing healthy hematopoietic stem cells to patients with dysfunctional or depleted bone marrow after a course of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. HSCT can be used in treating non-malignant conditions like hemoglobinopathies(sickle cell disease, Thalassemia), immune deficiency syndromes, and malignant conditions like multiple myeloma, Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and AML. ALL and CML. In cancer treatment, the rationale of this process is to eradicate residual cancer cells through graft versus tumor effect to cure the malignancy. (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK536951/"">Khaddour et al,2023</a>)</p>","<p>Various cardiac complications have been associated with different components of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), including the use of total body radiation in ablative therapy combined with a multi-drug conditioning regimen as well as transplant-related complications. The irradiation process induces calcification, thickening, and stiffness in the pericardium, potentially leading to constrictive pericarditis. The drug dimethyl sulfoxide, utilized for stem cell preservation, has been linked to adverse effects such as bradycardia and cardiac arrest. Also, certain chemotherapy medications like cytarabine and cyclophosphamide may contribute to conditions like congestive heart failure and pericarditis. Complications associated with transplantation, such as graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD), result in pericardial effusion, dysrhythmias, and coronary artery disease (CAD). Thrombotic microangiopathy from endothelial injury may also lead to systemic and pulmonary hypertension.

<p>The typical therapeutic approach for cardiac complications associated with HSCT relies on established treatments for chemotherapy-induced heart problems. This includes using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and certain beta-blockers. The protective benefits of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers against heart failure induced by anthracyclines have been evidenced in numerous clinical studies. While the ACE inhibitor enalapril has shown efficacy in preventing reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients treated with doxorubicin and/or daunorubicin at cumulative doses of 200 mg/m2 or more, this effect has not yet been demonstrated in the context of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Data is however limited in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9692512/"">Zhao, 2022</a>)</p>"
Anthracyclines,"<p>Anthracyclines are a class of drugs derived from the Streptomyces bacterium used in the treatment of various types of cancers. After the first type (daunorubicin) was discovered in the early 1960s, there have been other different types also approved for treatment. Cancers that anthracyclines are used to treat include Acute lymphocytic and myelogenous leukemia, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7093379/"">Cardinale et al, 2020</a>)</p>","<p>There are several proposed mechanisms of action of the anthracycline medication which include interaction with enzyme topoisomerase-II, &nbsp;DNA intercalation, DNA adduct formation, and Reactive oxygen species generation to cause DNA damage and lipid peroxidation.

CAR-T Cells,"<p>Chimeric antigen receptor T cell and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes therapies (CAR-T therapy). This therapy has been associated with Left Ventricular Dysfunction (LVD), Heart Failure (HF), cardiac arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest. However, all the mentioned cardiotoxic effects have been associated with the occurrence of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244"">ESC, 2022</a>). CRS is a systemic inflammatory response characterized by fever and one more of the following: hypotension, hypoxia and organ toxicity (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2022.07.014"">Ganatra et al, 2022</a>).&nbsp;</p>","<p>CAR-T cells are patient-derived T cells that are genetically engineered to target a tumor-specific antigen, inducing tumor cell apoptosis (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1056%2FNEJMra1706169"">June and Sadelain, 2018</a>). This tumor-cell apoptosis also leads to recruitment of other local immune cells like monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. It is this activation of the immune system by T-cell therapies that leads to an increase in circulating cytokines, such as IL-2, IFN-alpha, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors. IL-6 plays a key role in the mediation of CRS and in the pathophysiology of T-cell therapy-associated cardiotoxicity (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1056%2FNEJMra1706169"">June and Sadelain, 2018</a>). The up-regulation of IL-6 activates a signaling pathway that promotes oxidative stress, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy. Additionally, IL-6 alters the handling of calcium in the myocytes, reducing myocardial contractility, and potentially contributing to myocardial dysfunction and arrhythmias (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2018.01866"">Ali et al, 2019</a>).</p>","<p><strong>Target Antigen Cluster of Differentiation 19 (CD19)</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p><strong>Cytokine Release Syndrome Associated to CAR-T Cell Therapy</strong><br />Cytokine Release Syndrome is a phenomenon that is associated with CAR-T cell therapy, which involves a systemic inflammatory response with cytokines and cellular recruitment, mainly triggered by the activation of T cells upon the engagement of CAR by CD19. Such interaction leads to the release of other interleukins like IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and Granulocyte-Macrophage colony stimulating factor by activated T-Cells (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.02.011"">Ghosh et al, 2020</a>). IL-6 has been shown to be a key mediator in this reaction. As stated earlier, CRS has a wide spectrum of presentation; a useful system to grade CRS by severity is that of the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, which divides CRS into 4 Grades according to severity (See above)</p>
<p>Management of CRS depends on the grade, and lower grade CRS (Grade &le;2), can be managed with supportive care. In severe cases (Grade &ge;3), it has been seen that CRS can be treated with IL-6 blockade. Two agents are available for this, tocilizumab and siltuximab. The evidence regarding CRS improvement with Tocilizumab is more robust compared to siltuximab. Sometimes, additinal treatment with steroids is also required (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.02.011"">Ghosh et al, 2020</a>). The following management plan proposes a step-wise escalation to CRS after diagnosing and categorizing CRS using ASTCT consensus grading system (detailed above):</p>
<ul>
<li>If Grade 1 CRS, supportive treatment only</li>
<li>If &ge;Grade 2 CRS, consider tocilizumab</li>
<li>If persistent fevers, hypotension and/or hypoxia despite tocilizumab, consider use of corticosteroids (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.02.011"">Ghosh et al, 2020</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>More details on the particular management of CRS can be found in a review from 2017, where management is also divided according to ASTCT grading (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.148"">Neelapu et al, 2017</a>). </p>"
BTKI,"<p>Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (BTKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of lymphoid malignancies, like Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), B -cell malignancies like Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), Marginal Zone Lymphomas (MZL) and Waldenstr&ouml;m Macroglobulinemia (WM) (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244"">ESC, 2022</a>). BTKIs however are associated with a 3-5 fold increase in atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular arrhythmias, bleeding, stroke, and new or worsened hypertension. These cardiotoxic effects were more evident with first generation BTKIs, like ibrutinib, although newer TKIs still appear to be linked with cardiotoxic effects (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2023.09.002"">Quartermaine et al, 2023</a>).</p>","<p>Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) is a member of the Tec kinase family, which is a stress-activated kinase. It plays a role in antigen-dependent B-cell receptor signaling responsible for B-cell proliferation. The unchecked activation of this kinase triggers uncontrolled downstream cascades that are essential for the development of most B-cell malignancies (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa1215637"">Byrd et al, 2013</a>) . Most BTKIs interfere with the binding of BTK to downstream substrates. BTK is expressed in the cardiac tissue as well. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway is regulated by BTK and may play a role in cardiac response to stress. Ibrutinib targets the alpha-subunit of P13K, which is predominantly expressed in cardiovascular tissue. It is still unclear what is the mechanism of cardiotoxicity of other more selective BTKIs.</p>","<p><strong>First generation BTKIs</strong></p>

<p>Although there are no specific recommendations for the surveillance of RICVD during the RT (except for high-risk patient with CIED) (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244"">Lyon, 2022</a>), the current approach follows the same treatment and diagnostic approach as for non-RICVD. High sensitivity TnT (hs-cTnT) is an indicator of myocardial damage and might be found elevated during RT in those who received high RT doses (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.3857/roj.2021.00766"">Ellahham, 2021</a>). Routine monitoring of hs-cTnT could identify patients at high-risk of cardiac adverse events (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2021.07.035"">Xu, 2021</a>).

<ul>
<li>Comprehensive CV history and physical examination.</li>
<li>Review available imaging (CT, for assessment atherosclerotic calcifications).</li>
<li>Aggressive screening and optimization of baseline CVRF and CVD.</li>
<li>Patients considered at high risk, consider referral to cardiology or cardio-oncology (if available) for evaluation.</li>
<li>Utilize available advanced techniques and strategies to prevent RICVD focused on reduced radiation exposure of the heart and CV substructures during cancer treatment (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244"">Lyon, 2022</a>):</li>
<li>Modification of cancer management to omit RT</li>
<li>Modification of the dose and volume of RT where possible (minimum volume required to the minimum dose needed to obtain the desired clinical benefit)</li>
<li>Modification of delivery techniques to reduce cardiac radiation exposure should lead to a considerable reduction in risk (cardiac-sparing RT strategies).</li>
<li>Sparing RT techniques have evolved over time decreasing the cardiac radiation dose (e.g., MHD in HL has decreased from ~28.9 Gy with mantel RT to 2.1 Gy with combined techniques including involved-site RT) (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2021.06.007"">Bergom, 2021</a>).</li>

<p><strong>Cardiac-Sparing RT strategies (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2021.06.007"">Bergom, 2021</a>)</strong> <br />Types of cancer where the cardiac-sparing RT strategies may be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lymphoma, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, pediatric cancer)</li>
<li>Conformal therapy (3D-CRT): Photon beams designed using forward planning; minimize low dose bath; less conformality of high dose; can use a &ldquo;heart block&rdquo; to eliminate heart from the field using beam edge.</li>
<li>Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT)/volumetric-modulated arc therapy: Inverse planning using multiple photon beams or arcs to achieve conformality of high dose at the cost of increased low-dose exposure.
<ul>
<li>Proton therapy: Particle beam with Bragg peak phenomenon resulting in elimination of exit dose; enables both minimization of low dose and conformality of high dose.</li>
<li>Image-guided RT (IGRT)</li>
<li>Cone-beam CT: Low-dose CT obtained in treatment vault permits alignment based on visualization of internal anatomy.</li>
<li>Surface alignment: Uses surface anatomy for patient positioning; cannot visualize internal anatomy; no radiation exposure for this alignment technique.
<ul>
<li>Cardiac displacement and motion management techniques</li>
<li>Deep-inspiration breath hold: Using a device to measure depth of inspiration, patient is guided to hold breath for 10-20 seconds to displace thoracic anatomy from the heart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gating: Using an external abdominal device to gauge respiration, the beam is delivered during a set phase of the respiratory cycle when the heart is farthest from the target, and the beam shuts off when the patient exits this portion of the respiratory cycle.
<ul>
<li>Prone positioning: Displaces the target anatomy from the heart in many patients.</li>

<p><strong>General Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation C/1, L/C: A baseline echocardiogram is recommended in patients with a history of symptomatic CVD before starting fluoropyrimidines.</li>
<li>Recommendation C/2b, L/C: Screening for CAD may be considered in patients at high and very high risk of CAD before fluoropyrimidines.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Routine patient education about cardiac toxicity symptoms before treatment is recommended, with reinforcement with every cycle.</li>
<li>Patients who may be at presumed higher risk should be routinely referred to cardio-oncology for medication optimization (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.06.012"">Padegimas, 2020</a>).</li>
<li>Baseline ECG is recommended.</li>
<li>Pharmacotherapy and further cardiac workup are based on the patients&rsquo; individual CVRF and CVD per the current guidelines and expert opinion census recommendation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The precise role of age, CVRF, and CVD on the risk of coronary vasospasm remains uncertain (lower prevalence in patients with CVRF is thought to be due to concurrent use of cardioprotective medications with pre-existent CVD) (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.12.005"">Zafar, 2021</a>). </p>
<p><strong>Risk assessment during chemotherapy/treatment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FIC ranges from asymptomatic ECG changes to over ischemia and sudden cardiac death. The most common symptom of cardiotoxicity is anginal chest pain (typical or atypical) (<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000014057"">Peng, 2019</a>) due to coronary vasospasm from bolus dosing of FU often during the first exposure (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.06.012"">Padegimas, 2020</a>).</li>
<li>Given the low incidence of LV dysfunction attributed to FU, surveillance with TTE at specific intervals is not recommended beyond routine clinical evaluation (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1200/OP.20.00924"">Stone, 2021</a>).</li>
</ul>","<p>If FIC is suspected, therapy should be stopped immediately with prompt emergency department evaluation and management as presumed ACS. When recognized after chest pain resolution, this typically prompts a cardiovascular (or cardio-oncology if available) evaluation.</p>
<p>Evaluation includes ruling out underlying CAD/ACS. This includes further evaluation with 12-lead ECG, telemetry, cardiac biomarkers (NT-proBNP, Troponin) (ischemic ECG changes and troponin elevations may be undetectable), TTE, coronary CTA, stress testing (SPECT, PET), and coronary artery catheterization if clinically indicated (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jscai.2023.101264"">Mehta, 2023</a>).</p>
<p>Ultimate decision of rechallenge FU remains controversial and often discourage due the high recurrence rate of up 90% and death up to 13% (Sara, 2018). Alternative approaches (reduced dosing, alternate FU drugs, antidote [uridine triacetate] and alternative non-FU regimens) have either less efficacy or not available in the United States (Tegafur) (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jscai.2023.101264"">Padegimas, 2020</a>).</p>
<p>If FU-based treatment is considered the best cancer therapy a MDT decision involving cardiology (or cardio-oncology if available), oncology, radiation oncology and surgical oncology is recommended to weigh risks versus benefits to attempt a rechallenge of the therapy.</p>
<p><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.06.012"">Padegimas and Carver</a> shared a single center approach of successful 5-FU rechallenge with no recurrent cardiac toxicity.</p>

Multiple Myeloma Treatments,,"<p>Multiple Myeloma treatments encompass a variety of different drugs, each with a different mechanism of action. Proteasome Inhibitors (PIs) have been shown to cause cardiotoxicity by the impairment of activation of NF-KB, which affects angiogenesis and survival of cardiac myocytes, also with effect on vascular smooth muscle cells, making them more vulverable for atherosclerotic plaques (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41408-023-00849-z"">El-Cheikh et al, 2023</a>). Imunno Modulatory drugs (IMiDs) has also been associated with endothelial injury and dysfuction, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. <br />Additionally, patients with Multiple Myeloma are at elevated risk for thrombosis due to both patient and myeloma-related faactors, particularly the combination of PI and IMiD.
